# correlation-between-posture-MBTI-analysis
**Analysis correlation between posture &amp; MBTI analysis ü©∫üß†üìà.**

In this analysis I analyse dependence between MBTI and pain.
I don't get really intresting results, but this analysis was new lesson for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

I downloaded data from Kaggle : Correlation between Posture & Personality Trait

I analysed given features:

1)
- I vs E
*  introverts have smaller total pain than extroverts
- T vs F
* Thinking people have smaller total pain than feeling people
- J vs P
* Prospecting people have smaller total pain than Judging people

So after this analysis I can say: The smallest total pain have IXTP, but it's probably not real, because we don't have any data about INTP type and ISTP type have third the highest total pain from all types üôà.

2) 
Total pain in given group of type

This analysis show: analysts have the smallest total pain, after analyst are sentinels, after sentinels are diplomats and after diplomats are explorers. This are similar results to first analysis, because every explorer has P and every Dimplomat have F.

3)
Every type analysis

This analysis show the most interesting results, because first three the smallest types are from other groups of types. The smallest total pain have INTJ (analysts), ISFJ (sentinels) and ENFP (diplomats). This three types are totally diffrence, so...

... this analysis don't show dependece between MBTI and total pain. Only dependece what i see is between group of types ( analysts have small total pain, explorers have big), but imo this dataset is too little to evaluate dependece.
